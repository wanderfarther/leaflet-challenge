# leaflet-challenge

In this project, I created a map of earthquakes around the world using GeoJSON data from the USGS website that updates every minute. Each marker displays the location of the quake, the depth and magnitude. The size of the marker is based on the magnitude and the color is based on the recorded depth.  I used Leaflet to create the map and it's elements, and then used D3 to read in the data from the website. There are 2 tile layers, the inital one being a topographic map of the world, the second being a road map of the world.
